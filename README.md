Game_Of_Life

Game of life consists of a grid of cells . I will call it as an universe.

Rules

1. A living cell will survive into the next generation by default, unless:
2. it has fewer than two live neighbours (underpopulation).
3. it has more than three live neighbours (overpopulation).
4. A dead cell will spring to life if it has exactly three live neighbours (reproduction).


* Source code is gameoflife.py 
* Use run_GOL.py file for running the code.
   * Instructions will be printed on the screen
   * 1 for auto intilizing grid and 2 for manual selecting grid

The coverage for gameoflife.py and test_gameoflife.py is 100%

Use pip install -r requirement.txt for installing the used libraries
